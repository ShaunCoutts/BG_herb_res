# plotting the spatial model to see what is going on and start to understand what is happening 
# also and R version since the plotting in R is a bit more developed and flexible 
# getting the right data format might be annoying since each output will be a 3D array
# of X by g by |G| produced by julia, so the output needs to be flat, or atleast a format julia can produce 
# so I might have to flatten, then re-shape after import, will need dimention parameters for that, could be in first row
# then discard that row and return a list with the three arrays I want.
